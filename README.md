# broken-links-nightmare
This program uses nightmare to open up a page in D2L that lists the broken links at BYU-Idaho. 

The list found in D2L is then scraped and saved to a CSV file.
## Instructions
In order to use this file, run the 'linkpagescrape.js' file from the command line using 'node linkpagescrape.js'. The file will not run without a `credentials.json` file with only an object containing a username (of ol, cct or a functional equivalent) and a corresponding password.
